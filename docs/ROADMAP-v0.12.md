# Kubrick v0.12 Status and Continuation Roadmap

## Current state

Kubrick v0.12 is a CI-verified standalone Hermes symbolic compiler. The complete local pipeline now covers deterministic retrieval, private graph construction, structured audit, storyboard continuity, provider adaptation, visual QA, correction governance, outcome receipts, proposal-only evolution, and repeatability verification.

## Completed

- Unified `kubrick` CLI and compiler.
- Schema validation for graph, storyboard, adapter, observation, fidelity, correction, outcome, evolution, and iteration artifacts.
- Canonical three-frame storyboard example.
- Storyboard state propagation and transition diagnostics.
- Neutral model-adapter contract and Grok Imagine adapter.
- Structured visual observations and targeted correction packets.
- Bounded correction-loop governance.
- Pattern-use observations and human-reviewed evolution proposals.
- Stable-output repeatability checks in CI.

## Release reconciliation still required

- Align `SKILL.md`, README, changelog, compiler metadata, and corpus metadata to the authoritative `VERSION` file.
- Verify README and QUICKSTART commands directly in CI.
- Validate installation from a clean copied Hermes skill directory.
- Complete `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST-v0.12.md`.
- Create and publish the `v0.12.0` tag only after those gates pass.

## Post-v0.12 priorities

1. Add Flux, SD3, Midjourney, and video adapters as syntax-only translations over the neutral packet.
2. Add optional vision-provider normalizers while retaining manual and generic JSON observation paths.
3. Add privacy-preserving cross-project analytics from approved outcome receipts.
4. Add optional MCP wrappers over the existing CLI without making MCP authoritative.
5. Expand the executable corpus only with provenance, misuse risks, mutation requirements, production-cost analysis, and regression coverage.

## Invariants

- Weak evidence returns `NOT_COMPUTABLE`.
- Audience output exposes observables, not private symbolic semantics.
- Local artifacts remain `PROPOSED`.
- Outcome receipts remain observations.
- Evolution proposals never apply automatically.
- External providers, MCP, and Continuity Forge remain optional.
